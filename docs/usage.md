# Symparsec usage notes
## How to read the Haddocks
Haddock displays kind signatures inline. This is clunky as you don't usually
care how a parser like `$>` is implemented, just how to use it (i.e. the kind).

I write standalone kind signatures for parsers.
Consider reading the source code instead.
